This is a tool to merge the jpg and png files from scanned manga into a single pdf file.  

# Requirements:  
Cmake >= 3.6  
Boost >= 1.61.0.2  
LibHaru >= 2.3.0 RC 3-19-gd84867e  
Magic++ >= 6.q16  

It has been tested on Ubuntu 16.10  
But I can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone.  

Bugs:  
Arguments can only be complete paths - relative paths don't work.
